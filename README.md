### Setting up the app

This app is developed with Create React App -- instructions at https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.

To install, just clone the repo and run `yarn install`.

Run the app with `yarn start`.

Build the optimized / deployable app with `yarn run build`.

Preview the deployable build by first installing `serve` globally: `yarn install -g serve@^5.1.5`.

Then serve the built app with `yarn run preview`.

Code style is ES2016+ with React. If you're not used to it, no worries, you'll pick it up fast. Ask me if you have any questions. :)

### Publishing the app

Run `yarn run deploy`. That's it!
